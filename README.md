### Hi there 👋

<!--
**jasonbringle/jasonbringle** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning soft skills while coding in React and Node/js
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with computer science paradigms.
- 💬 Ask me about composing and music.  I am a full time composer!
- 📫 How to reach me: jasonbringle@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Remember the "Flo" campaign from Progressive Insurance?  I wrote the main theme for those commercials!
- BUT REALLY:  I'm a junior web dev trying to make my way into the space by being able to contribute in real ways.  I dont just want a job... 
I want to build knowledge to continue doing this for the remainder of my time here on earth so that I can contribute/teach others and build awesome stuff
to improve this world!
